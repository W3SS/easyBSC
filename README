Small and lightweight set of tools to create dashboards, imposed by balanced
scorecards system, which is so beloved by all senior managers and amateur suits.
Main goal of this activity is to create the layer which provides an access to
the data below. So that all these indicators, those could be fetched from
databases, web-services, Excel spreadsheets, other sources with the little help
of similiar php-classes or web-services.
Next step is to provide the simplest interface possible to allow manual KPI data
entry and dashboard creation so that metrics data, entered manually, could be
combined into different dashboards and used instead of lousy spreadsheet-based
BSC dashboards.
